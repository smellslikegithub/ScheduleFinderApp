# ScheduleFinderApp
This is my implementation of a possible solution for the case-study provided by PatientSky for the Back End test. It is a Maven based JAVA project, so in order to run it, download it and make sure all the dependencies are installed. Finally, run the App.java file. I used IntelliJ IDE, you can use whatever that suits you best. The Java version i used was 8.
